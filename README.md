# I'm most excited about learning how to create efficient programs in CPSC 350. I think this is essential to make software the runs smoother, and this is a big part of creating a good video game. Someday, I want to make a video game that tells a story with great graphics and mechanic, and I think this is impossible without a thorough understanding of which data structures to use where. I'm also excited to learn more about C++, because I didn't learn about it before this class. I know it will be tough, but I think with enough time and dedication, I can do it.
